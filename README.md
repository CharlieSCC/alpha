### Data
    All data must be BOD. 
    For the universe, if it changes at 2014-12, then it is named as xxx-2015.
    FOr the graph, if it uses the 2014-12 finacial report, then it is named as xxx-2015.

### Factor
    Now we only include pv factor, which is published in alpha 101.

### Model
    Recurrent Model:
    - LSTM
    - GRU
    - Transformer
    
    Graph Model
    - LSTM_GCN
    - TGC
    - HATS
    - THGNN
